              <h2>What is HackSoc?</h2>
            </div>

            <p>HackSoc is the computer science society here at the
            University of York, although you don't need to be a
            computer science student to participate. We run a mixture
            of academic and social events, providing a way for people
            to learn about things they're interested in, which may not
            necessarily be covered by the actual course.</p>

            <p>Whilst plans for the next academic year are a bit hazy
            at the moment, we will be running an
            intermediate-level <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>
            course in the Spring term, and hope to run some
            introductory courses in the Autumn term.</p>

            <p>You can find more information on our
            website, <a href="http://www.hacksoc.org">hacksoc.org</a>.</p>

            <div class="page-header">
              <h2>What events do you run?</h2>
            </div>

            <p>We run a mixture of academic and social events. Our
            academic events consist of lectures and seminars, which
            anyone can ask to run. We try to run one or two courses
            each term as well. Our staple social events are boardgames
            evenings and visiting pubs, although we're considering
            branching out.</p>

            <p>We're also looking into the possibility of guest
            lectures and trips for next year, although currently these
            are very provisional.</p>

              <h2>What do I do on moving in day?</h2>
            </div>

            <p>Firstly, make sure you know which car park is closest
            to your college, as carrying your stuff all over the place
            is not fun. There are lots of car parks, so you should be
            able to find one fairly close to your new home. Once you
            arrive, there should be a plethora of helpers wandering
            around, guiding people to and fro, and helping people
            transport their things. You'll want to go get your keys
            and university card, and someone will probably grab you
            and take you to where that's happening as soon as you get
            out of the car.</p>

            <p>Once you have your keys, go find your room and proceed
            to move things over there. Again, there will be people to
            help you if you get lost, so don't be afraid to
            ask. Furthermore, there are trolleys (Â£10 deposit
            required), so if you're lucky you might be able to get one
            before they are all gone.</p>

            <p>Leave your door open, and go introuce yourself to your
            flatmates. Remember: they're just as confused as you
            are. Later in the day, your STYCs (Second and Third Year
            Contacts) will arrive, these are two people who are
            assigned to look after your flat for freshers' week, and
            are typically very nice people. Their job is to answer any
            questions you might have, so ask away.</p>

            <p>To finish the day, there will be some sort of college
            welcome event, which your STYCs will take you to.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="who-will-look-after-me">
            <div class="page-header">
              <h2>Who will look after me?</h2>
            </div>

            <p>Fortunately, the university and YUSU are rather used to
            people being lost when they arrive, and so provide many
            points of contact if you need help.</p>

            <p>During freshers week you will have two STYCs (Second
            and Third Year Contacts), whose job is to provide any help
            you need during that week. You will also be assigned a
            supervisor, an academic in your department who will look
            after you for all of your time at York. Finally, your
            college will have a welfare team, YUSU has a welfare team,
            and there are other societies like Nightline who also
            provide support.</p>

            <p>We all know that starting a totally new life can be
            scary and confusing, so if you need any help at all, don't
            be afraid to ask anyone. Even if they can't solve your
            problem, they should be able to point you to someone who
            can.</p>

          <section id="what-are-the-colleges">
            <div class="page-header">
              <h2>What are the colleges?</h2>
            </div>

            <p>For organisational purposes, the university is divided
            into a number of undergraduate colleges, and one
            postgraduate college (Wentworth). However, unlike many
            universities, which college you end up in isn't terribly
            important. You will be a member of a college for your time
            at York, and the major thing this affects is where you
            live in your first year. Colleges do run events such as
            film nights, trips, toasties, and so on, but in general,
            anyone from any college can turn up to any event.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="where-should-i-live">
            <div class="page-header">
              <h2>How do I apply for accommodation, and where should I live?</h2>
            </div>

            <p>Once you have accepted an unconditional offer (that is,
            you have your results and confirmed that York is where
            you'll be going), you will receive an email giving you
            access to the online application system for
            acommodation. On results day, the emails are sent out over
            a 48 hour period randomly, so you may not get yours until
            the next day, but don't worry. Once you make your
            application, you'll receive a room offer within three
            days, after which you must pay a deposit to confirm it. If
            you don't confirm within a few days, your offer will be
            withdrawn, and you'll have to apply again.</p>

            <p>Which college you apply to depends mostly on what
            you'll be studying, and what you want. Some colleges offer
            en-suite rooms, some offer catering, some are on the main
            campus, some are on the Heslington East campus. Hes East
            houses Goodricke and Langwith colleges, and also the
            departments of Computer Science; Theatre, Film, and
            Television; and Law and Management.</p>
